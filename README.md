A Compendium of Games in Python

From Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock (first made famous on "The Big Bang Theory"), a number of games created in Python.

Acknowledgements: many thanks to Stanford University who inspired many people including myself to become Pythonistas with their "Code in Place" course.
